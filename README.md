This suite guarantees that the patient management features are functioning properly and that data can be manipulated accurately.

3. **Automated_Dynamic_Search_Test.java:**
   This Selenium automated test file aims to test the dynamic search functionality of a web application.

This suite ensures that users can effectively search for information and that the search results are accurate and up-to-date.

4. **Automated_Login_Test.java:**
   This Selenium test file is responsible for automating the login process of a web application. It includes test cases that simulate various login scenarios, such as valid username and password, incorrect credentials, and more. This suite guarantees that users can access the application securely and that any authentication-related issues are identified and addressed.

5. **Automated_User_Registration_Test.java:**
   This Selenium automated test file is focused on automating the user registration process.
